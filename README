JEFF PHP FRAMEWORK by Otto srl, MIT license
===================================================================
Jeff is a light php framework design to help the programmer in the 
developement of a web site or web application. It's written
following the MVC pattern. Other patterns are used in the
framework.
The project is in developement, no stable release still exists.
Even if I consider it quite stable, it's incomplete. It has many
features and capabilities that have to be fully implemented.
